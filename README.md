### Features
---------------------------------------
- Bootstrap5 based creation, I used a CDN and kept all changes within local CSS and JS files.
- Pre-Coded Contact Form, the contact form uses JavaScript to send the form data to an API. Inside the form's JS file, please add the URL for the API handling the emails there.
- Minimal JavaScript to increase page load speed.
- Elegant Design, it is simple yet professional.
- Responsive Design, it will work across device sizes.
- Counter that is adjustable within the Assets/JS/Counter.js file.
- Service page with service cards, to add more just copy/paste the container and change it to what you would like.
